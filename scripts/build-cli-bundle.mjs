/**
 * Bundles the NeuroGate CLI (src/cli/index.ts, TypeScript + ESM + a
 * multi-file internal import graph reaching into src/lib and src/types)
 * into a single dependency-free CommonJS file, dist-cli/cli.cjs.
 *
 * This is step 1 of 2 for producing a standalone `neurogate` binary
 * (see build-cli-sea.mjs for step 2, the actual Node "single executable
 * application" packaging). Node's SEA feature requires ONE JS file with
 * no external module resolution at runtime -- it can't `require()` or
 * dynamically `import()` project files off disk once injected into a
 * binary, so everything has to be flattened first. That's exactly what
 * esbuild's bundler does here.
 *
 * Node built-ins (fs, path, node:child_process, etc.) are left as
 * `require()` calls rather than bundled -- esbuild does this
 * automatically for platform: 'node', and it's correct: those modules
 * are provided by the Node runtime the SEA blob gets injected into, not
 * something we need to (or safely could) bundle ourselves.
 *
 * The CLI has two `await import(...)` calls in index.ts (a quick
 * pre-scan pass before the main pipeline run) -- both are static string
 * literals, so esbuild resolves and inlines them into this same single
 * output file rather than treating them as real runtime code-splitting
 * (which only applies to multi-entry ESM builds, not this single-file
 * CJS bundle).
