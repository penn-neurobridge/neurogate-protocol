/**
 * NeuroGate CLI (interactive entry point)
 *
 * Gathers options via terminal prompts, then hands off to
 * runNeuroGatePipeline() in pipeline.ts for the actual
 * scan/detect/validate/export work -- this file's only job is turning
 * human answers into a NeuroGateRunOptions object and printing the
 * result. See pipeline.ts's module doc for why the two are split.
 *
 * Scope for this version: no interactive per-file correction (the web
 * app's mapping table has no CLI equivalent yet). If detection finds
 * unclassified files or validation reports blocking errors, the CLI
 * reports them and stops rather than guessing -- fixing generally means
 * reorganizing the source folder and re-running, or using the website
 * for cases that need per-file overrides. That's a deliberate v1
 * boundary, not an oversight. See
 * Documents/NeuroGate_Phase_Roadmap.md, "Phase 4/6 Revision," Step 2.
 *
 * NODE-ONLY.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx src/cli/index.ts [source-folder]
 * (once packaged: neurogate [source-folder])
