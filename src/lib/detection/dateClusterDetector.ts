/**
 * Custom Timepoints Date-Cluster Detector (Layer A)
 *
 * See Documents/Phase1b_Custom_Timepoint_Detection_Spec.md Section 3.1.
 *
 * The literal label match in customSessionDetector.ts only works when a
 * file's name or folder path already contains the exact timepoint label
 * (e.g. "ses-2mo"). Real-world messy datasets rarely have that. This
 * layer uses real acquisition timestamps instead -- already read by
 * edfHeaderReader.ts (EDF/BDF) and sidecarReader.ts (dcm2niix JSON
 * sidecars) for other purposes, now also consulted here.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT try to compute an absolute duration ("is this
 * really 2 months after baseline"). It only orders a subject's own files
 * relative to each other: cluster files by calendar visit, sort the
 * clusters chronologically, then map them onto the dataset's own
 * chronologically-sorted timepoint list in order. This sidesteps the
 * "what counts as day zero" problem entirely -- there's no reference
 * date needed, just relative order.
 *
 * Auto-assignment only fires when the number of date-clusters found for
 * a subject exactly matches the number of defined timepoints. A mismatch
 * (missed visit, extra rescan, stray bad timestamp) is left unresolved
 * with an explanatory reason rather than guessed -- consistent with how
 * every other low-confidence case in this engine works.
