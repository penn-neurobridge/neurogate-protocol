 * sidecars state this outright in the DICOM ImageType field, verified
 * against the Phase2_MRI corpus on 2026-08-17:
 *
 *   ep2d_diff_SliceAcc_b1k_64      ['ORIGINAL','PRIMARY','DIFFUSION','NONE','ND','MOSAIC']

 *   ..._revPE_b0s_te122_TW         ['ORIGINAL','PRIMARY','DIFFUSION','NONE','ND','MOSAIC']
 *
 * Note the last two: _TRACEW is derived but a trailing _TW is ORIGINAL raw
 * data, so _TW is deliberately NOT in this list. That distinction was
 * confirmed from the sidecars rather than inferred from the names.
 *
 * These maps carry no bval/bvec, so putting them in dwi/ produces a
 * dataset a BIDS validator rejects, and a tractography pipeline could
 * silently ingest an ADC map as raw diffusion. Returning no modality
 * keeps them out of the export and surfaces them in the mapping table for
