/**
 * Custom Timepoints Folder-Cluster Detector (Layer B)
 *
 * See Documents/Phase1b_Custom_Timepoint_Detection_Spec.md Section 3.2.
 *
 * For datasets organized as one subfolder per visit, without an embedded
 * timepoint label (customSessionDetector.ts already covers that) and
 * without a usable acquisition date on any file (dateClusterDetector.ts
 * already covers that): if a subject's files split cleanly into exactly
 * as many distinct immediate-parent folders as the dataset has defined
 * timepoints, order those folders -- by a number embedded in the folder
 * name if every folder has one, otherwise alphabetically as a
 * last-resort, lowest-confidence signal -- and map them onto the
 * dataset's own chronologically-sorted timepoint list, the same way
 * Layer A maps date clusters.
 *
 * Deliberately the lowest-confidence of the three new layers: folder
 * order alone (especially alphabetical) is a much weaker guarantee than
 * a real timestamp, and this only ever runs for files Layer A already
 * couldn't resolve.
